Welcome to libxbee v3!

Please note that this project is still in development, so should not be used for
any purpose other than learning/playing/testing etc... Basically don't use it to
make money, and then hold me responsible if it breaks!

Feel free to contact me directly with any queries:
  attie@attie.co.uk


=== Installation ===
To install libxbee simply type:
  $ make install


=== Usage ===
Compile your applications, including "xbee.h"
Link with -lxbee

If you are compiling the object file directly into your executable instead
of making use of the shared library, you must include the following link
flags:
  -lpthread -lrt


=== Samples ===
I have proveded sample code in the ./sample directory. Hopefully this will help
get you up and running with libxbee. If you would like samples showing a different
aspect of libxbee, then please do not hesitate to get in contact, or file an
'issue' on the project site, and I will get to it ASAP:
